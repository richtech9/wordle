## Introduction

Wordle is a word game similar to the TV show [Lingo](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(British_game_show)>).

You get 6 tries to guess a 5-letter target word. After each guess, the letters light up in various colors as clues. Green means a letter is correct in this spot; yellow means a letter is _elsewhere_ in the target word; gray means a letter is not in the target word at all.
